# Hypothyroidsm Prediction Model

The goal of this project is to use healthcare data provided by Nairobi Hospital to build a prediction model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate the existence of hypothyroid. The analysis will compare the prediction models from DecisionTree Classifier and that of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to establish the best prediction model.

# Project Description

Hypothyroidsm is a medical condition in which an individual's thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This deficiency in thyroid hormone can disrupt crucial body functions such as body tempreture, heart rate and metabolism. Some of the general symptoms of hypothyroidsm include fatigue, muscle weakness, thinning hair, enlarged thyroid gland among others. The risks posed by a hypothyroid condition can be extreme when left untreated over a long period of time. Therefore, it is imperative that an accurate diagnosis is made as early as possible and treatment is administered appropriately.

This research aims to use robust machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model that can identify whether or not a patient has a hypothyroid condition based on their symptoms. The model will be trained on thyroid patients' data that was collected by Nairobi Hospital. The dataset used contains various patient records including age and sex. The patients' were either classified as having hypothroid or not. The total number of attributes in the dataset are 26 and number of records are 3163. This dataset contains useful information and multiple dimension features that can allow us to train a hypothyroid classification model successfully.
